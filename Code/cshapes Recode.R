## this script recodes countries in cshapes that change status within the same
## year. this happens when borders change or capitals are moved and the effective
## date is anything other than december 31. it uses a rule where any change that
## occurs in the first half of a year results in that iteration of a country
## ending the previous year. if a change occurs in the second half of a year,
## that year is the last year of the previous iteration of the country and the
## new iteration begins the following year. it requires that cshapes has been
## loaded from shapefile into a spatialpointsdataframe or sfc
